%% - Server module
%% - The server module creates a parallel registered process by spawning a process which 
%% evaluates initialize(). 
%% The function initialize() does the following: 
%%      1/ It makes the current process as a system process in order to trap exit.
%%      2/ It creates a process evaluating the store_loop() function.
%%      4/ It executes the server_loop() function.
%%
%% Modified by Martin Doversten, Thomas NordstrÃ¶m VT2011
%% Server uses a type of two phase commit to ensure Actomicity, Isolation, Concurrency for all transactions.
%% We ensure this by using a locking list which keeps track of all currently used (reading, writing) variables in the database.
%% When the server tries to excute a new transaction all variables needs to not be in the lock list.
%% If any variable is locked of a transaction, that transaction in enqueued to the waiting list and any unlocked varible will be locked by that transaction. This is to avoid starvation and deadlocks.
%% The server will only excute the transaction if all operations is recieved from the client.
%% If packet loss occurs the server requests a resend from the client and saves the recvied packages.
